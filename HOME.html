        <h4>Student</h4>
        <p>"Study Sation helped me go from C's to A's in just 3 months! The practice tests and videos made everything so much easier to understand, and I could study at my own pace. I actually started looking forward to revising because it didn’t feel boring anymore. I finally feel confident going into exams."</p>
